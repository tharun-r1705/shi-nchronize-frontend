# Ported Features: Leaderboard & Progress

This document summarizes the **Leaderboard** and **Progress** features ported from the original `EvolvED` folder to `EvolvED v2`.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Leaderboard Functionality**
- **File**: `src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches top 50 students by readiness score from backend
  - **Podium display**: Top 3 students with animated cards (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
  - **Current user highlight**: Shows logged-in student's rank and personalized card
  - **Full leaderboard list**: Sortable by rank, with details on streak, projects, achievements, badges
  - **Profile dialog**: Click "View Profile" to see student details in a modal
  - **Share achievement**: Copy/share achievements via native Web Share API or clipboard
  - **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly with framer-motion animations
  - **TypeScript-safe**: Fully typed data structures

### 2. **Progress Analytics**
- **File**: `src/pages/Progress.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **LeetCode integration**: Automatically fetch and display LeetCode stats (total solved, streak, difficulty breakdown, top domains, submission calendar, recent activity)
  - **Charts & Visualizations**:
    - **Pie chart**: Easy/Medium/Hard problem distribution
    - **Bar chart**: Top 5 problem domains
    - **Heatmap**: 52-week submission calendar (GitHub-style)
    - **Area chart**: Weekly submission trend
  - **Auto-sync**: Silent background sync of LeetCode data if username is configured
  - **Manual refresh**: Button to manually update stats
  - **Recent sessions**: Display imported LeetCode practice sessions

### 3. **Backend API**
- **Controller**: `backend/controllers/studentController.js`
  - `getLeaderboard` – Public endpoint to fetch top students
  - `updateLeetCodeStats` – Endpoint to verify LeetCode username and fetch stats
  - `updateCodingProfiles` – Save LeetCode/HackerRank usernames
  - `syncCodingActivity` – Sync coding logs from external platforms
- **Routes**: `backend/routes/studentRoutes.js`
  - `GET /api/students/leaderboard` – Public
  - `POST /api/students/:id/update-leetcode` – Protected
  - `PUT /api/students/coding-profiles` – Protected
  - `POST /api/students/coding-sync` – Protected

### 4. **Routing**
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- Routes already defined:
  - `/leaderboard` → `Leaderboard.tsx`
  - `/student/progress` → `Progress.tsx`

## 📦 Dependencies
All required dependencies are already present in `package.json`:
- `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`
- `framer-motion` (for animations)
- `lucide-react` (for icons)
- `recharts` (for charts and graphs)
- UI components from `@/components/ui/*` (shadcn/ui)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend** (if running):
   ```powershell
   cd "i:\main\EvolvED v2\backend"
   npm run dev
   ```
   > ⚠️ **Important**: The backend `leetcode.js` utility was updated to fetch comprehensive stats (calendar, domains, etc.). Restart is required.

2. **Start the frontend** (if not running):
   ```powershell
   cd "i:\main\EvolvED v2"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the features**:
   - Navigate to `/leaderboard` to see the global leaderboard
   - Navigate to `/student/progress` (after logging in) to view LeetCode analytics
   - Update your LeetCode profile link in the Profile page, then refresh stats in Progress
   - The following sections should now work:
     - ✅ Top 5 Problem Domains (bar chart + list)
     - ✅ Submission Calendar (52-week heatmap)
     - ✅ Weekly Submission Trend (area chart)
     - ✅ Recent LeetCode Activity (session list)

---

## 🎯 Key Differences from Original

- ✅ **Navbar updated**: Progress page now includes "Leaderboard" link in the navbar
- ✅ **API endpoints**: Already wired in `EvolvED v2` backend (no changes needed)
- ✅ **TypeScript support**: Full type safety with `StudentProfileDTO` and other interfaces
- ✅ **Build verified**: Project builds successfully with no errors

---

## 📝 Notes

- The **Badge** component in `EvolvED v2` uses standard props (children, variant), so no changes were needed
- The **recharts** library is already installed for data visualization
- The **framer-motion** library handles all animations
- Both pages are fully functional and ready to use
